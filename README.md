A data-driven approach for soil moisture estimation using a sparse sensor network. It integrates Compressed Sensing, DMDc, and Kalman Filtering to reduce sensor deployment while maintaining accuracy. Data is generated via Finite Element Simulation of the 3D Richards Equation. Optimized for precision irrigation.
